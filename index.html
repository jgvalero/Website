        <p>
            Hello! My name is Jose Valero and I am a student attending Arizona State University.
            I am a Computer Science major (upcoming Junior) with a minor in Psychology!
        </p>
        <p>
            I like to spend my days working on a project, playing games, and hanging out with friends!
            When I have a project, I usually try to work on it when I can. I've been working and updating
            a Discord bot that has several features, but I haven't been working on it lately because I can't
            think of any more ideas to add. As for playing games, my most played games are Rocket League,
            Valorant, and Titanfall 2!
        </p>
